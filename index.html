            <p>I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2017 and avoided any form of programming like the plague.
                Since then, I've worked full time and have had some experience with coding for hardware design using lagnuages like Verilog and some C++.
                I've realized that programming isn't as scary as I once thought, but lacking the knowledge to perform (and excel) at my job, is.
                To avoid having to ever face that fear in the first place, I've decided to take up programming as a skill and hobby.
                Here you'll find a collection of my public projects, as well as a way to get in touch if you'd like to chat about any of my works, job recquisitions, or the Flat Earth theory.
